## Overview  

This externship was part of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Security Engineering Virtual Experience Program. The program simulated real-world responsibilities of a Security Engineer working in a fast-paced financial services environment. It emphasized practical SOC operations, AppSec remediation, and applied machine learning for fraud detection and email filtering.

As an extern, I completed three core projects focused on strengthening organizational cybersecurity posture:

---

## 1. Security Data Analytics  
- Analyzed over 2 million financial transaction logs using Python and Pandas.  
- Identified fraud patterns including spoofing, duplication, and account tampering.  
- Proposed SOC process enhancements to improve alert triage efficiency.

---

## 2. Machine Learning for Email Security  
- Developed a spam detection system using Scikit-learn.  
- Achieved approximately 93% accuracy and reduced false positives by 55%.  
- Demonstrated how ML techniques can improve SOC alert fidelity and reduce analyst workload.

---

## 3. Secure Code Review & SAST  
- Conducted static analysis on a vulnerable Flask-based internal web application.  
- Identified critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities such as path traversal and IDOR.  
- Proposed code-level remediations and discussed SSDLC integration strategies.

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated  

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)  
- SOC Data Pipeline Analysis  
- Secure Coding & SDLC Integration  
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
- OWASP Top 10 Remediation

## Final Note  

This externship strengthened my practical understanding of both offensive and defensive security in a high-stakes financial environment. It also helped bridge the gap between SOC operations, secure development practices, and real-world tooling.
