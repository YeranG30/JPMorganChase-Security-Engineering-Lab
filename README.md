**Issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. â€“ December 2023**  
Completed via Forageâ€™s Security Engineering Virtual Experience



This repository captures my work during JPMorgan's industry-sponsored Security Lab. The engagement was designed to simulate real-world SOC and AppSec workflows, including data pipeline analysis, secure software design, and fraud detection modeling.

## Overview

As an Industry Lab Participant, I completed three core exercises:

1. **Security Data Analytics**
   - Analyzed over 2 million financial transaction logs using Python and Pandas.
   - Identified fraud patterns such as spoofing, duplication, and account tampering.
   - Proposed SOC process enhancements to streamline alert triage.

2. **Machine Learning for Email Security**
   - Developed a spam detection system using Scikit-learn.
   - Achieved ~93% accuracy and reduced false positives by 55%.
   - Demonstrated how machine learning can strengthen SOC alert fidelity.

3. **Secure Code Review & SAST**
   - Conducted static analysis on a vulnerable Flask-based web app.
   - Identified OWASP Top 10 issues including path traversal and IDOR.
   - Proposed code-level remediations and discussed SDLC integration for security.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- OWASP Top 10 Remediation
- SOC Data Pipeline Analysis
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Secure Coding & AppSec Best Practices
