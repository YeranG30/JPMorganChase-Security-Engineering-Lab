# jpmorgan cybersecurity virtual experience (forage)

this repository contains my completed tasks from the industry-sponsored jpmorgan chase & co. cybersecurity virtual experience, focused on data analytics, fraud detection, email classification, and application security analysis.

## tasks

###  task 1: fraud detection
analyzed mobile payment transaction data using pandas to detect fraud patterns such as spoofed identities and high-risk transfers.  
• tools: python, pandas, seaborn  
• concepts: anomaly detection, fraud signal analysis, soc simulation  
→ `task1_fraud_detection/`

### task 2: email filtering engine
built a spam email classifier using tf-idf vectorization and naive bayes to support soc email triage and reduce false positives.  
• tools: python, scikit-learn, tf-idf  
• concepts: spam classification, soc workflow optimization  
→ `task2_email_filtering/`

###  task 3: appsec static analysis
performed static analysis of a vulnerable flask web app to identify common security flaws and recommend secure coding practices.  
• tools: markdown, code review  
• concepts: owasp top 10, static analysis, secure devops  
→ `task3_appsec_analysis/`

## technologies used

- python  
- pandas, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- flask  
- markdown / secure coding  
- static analysis principles

## outcome

this lab strengthened my practical skills in fraud analytics, machine learning in cybersecurity, and application security code reviews — simulating real workflows in soc and appsec environments.
